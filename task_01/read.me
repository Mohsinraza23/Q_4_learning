## 🌐 What is Artificial Intelligence?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the science of developing machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence.  
These tasks include:

- 🧠 **Learning**
- 📅 **Planning**
- 📚 **Knowledge Representation**
- 👁️ **Perception**
- 🧩 **Problem Solving**

AI systems leverage vast amounts of data to improve over time, adapting from patterns and experiences just like humans do.

## 🤖 What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI** is a specialized branch of AI that focuses on **creating** new content rather than analyzing existing data.

### 🔧 It uses techniques like:
- Deep Learning
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language Processing

### 🎨 It can generate:
- 📝 **Text** (like this README!)
- 🖼️ **Images**
- 🎵 **Music**
- 💬 **Speech**
- 💻 **Code**

Generative AI is revolutionizing creativity by blending human-like imagination with machine precision.

## 🧠 Types of Generative AI Models

### 1. 🎭 **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- Two networks (generator + discriminator) compete to create realistic data.

### 2. 🧮 **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
- Learn patterns in data to generate new, high-dimensional data points.

### 3. 🧾 **Autoregressive Models**
- Predict the next item in a sequence (like GPT).

### 4. 🔁 **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- Ideal for sequence prediction in speech and language.

### 5. 🔄 **Flow-Based Models**
- Use invertible functions to model complex distributions.
